# C-Real-time-Application

C++ Application Development for Real-time Systems  (Aug 2024)
Technologies Used: C++11, Linux/Unix, Multithreading, Inter-Process Communication (IPC), Git, CMake, Design Patterns

Developed a real-time system application using C++11 on a Linux/Unix environment, adhering to object-oriented design principles and implementing advanced features like STL containers and algorithms.
Implemented multithreading and IPC mechanisms to manage concurrent data processing, resulting in a 30% increase in system efficiency and responsiveness.
Optimized system performance by identifying and resolving bottlenecks, memory leaks, and synchronization issues, ensuring seamless execution under high load conditions.
Designed and utilized templates to create reusable code components, improving overall code maintainability and reducing development time by 20%.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate the application into larger system architectures, using Git for version control and CMake for build automation.
